    This property is a multiplier on the amount of Air Absorption applied to the Source. The

    AL_AIR_ABSORPTION_FACTOR is multiplied by an internal Air Absorption Gain HF value of 0.994 (-0.05dB) per meter

    which represents normal atmospheric humidity and temperature.

  syntax:
    content: AirAbsorptionFactor = 131079

    This property is defined the same way as the Reverb Room Rolloff property: it is one of two

    methods available in the Effect Extension to attenuate the reflected sound (early reflections and reverberation)

    according to source-listener distance.

  syntax:
    content: RoomRolloffFactor = 131080

    A directed Source points in a specified direction. The Source sounds at full volume when the

    listener is directly in front of the source; it is attenuated as the listener circles the Source away from the

    front.
