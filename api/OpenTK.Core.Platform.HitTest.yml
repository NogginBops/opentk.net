  summary: >-
    A delegate for hit testing.


    Hit testing is not always done in respone to the user clicking the mouse.

    The operating system can do hit testing for any reason and doesn't need to be in respose to some user action.

    It is recommended to keep this code efficient as it will be called often.
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: public delegate HitType HitTest(WindowHandle handle, Vector2 position)
    parameters:
    - id: handle
      type: OpenTK.Core.Platform.WindowHandle
      description: A handle to the window that hit testing is being done on.
    - id: position
      type: OpenTK.Mathematics.Vector2
      description: The position of where the hit test is being done, not always the position of the mouse. In client relative coordinates.
    return:
      type: OpenTK.Core.Platform.HitType
      description: The result of the hit test.
